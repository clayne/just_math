// JUST MATH:
// Belief Propagation - on a 3D grid domain
//
// Demonstration of Sum-Product Belief Propagation on a 3D spatial domain.
// Computes:
//     mu_{i,j}[b] = SUM f_{i,j}[a,b] g_i[a] PROD mu_{k,i}[b]
// The message function 'mu' is stored sparsely for neighboring cells in 3D, with size 6*R^3*B,
// where R is the grid resolution, B is the number of discrete values, and 6 is number of neighbors.
//
// To render the result, the belief is estimated at each vertex (voxel), and
// raytraced as a density volume where value probabilities are mapped to color.
