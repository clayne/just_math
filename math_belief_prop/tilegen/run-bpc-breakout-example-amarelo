#
# A note on usage:
#
# The 'name' and 'rule' files are required for a bpc run,
# as is the X, Y, Z dimension.
#
# The 'map' or 'tiled_fn' is the output rendered to a tiled
# JSON file, using the specified tileset_fn (path relative to
# where the tiled JSON file is) and the stride is the tile
# width.
# Specifying the map file makes sure the output gets saved in
# a reasonable way (otherwise you'd have to parse the 'verbose'
# output to make a reasonable rendering of the output) and
# the tileset_fn and stride are not technically needed but
# are used to populate the appropriate JSON values in the tiled
# file.
#
# The -J 'd 0` option culls the 0 tile.
# The 0 (or 'null') tile is special in the 2D tileset contexts
# of this sort and represent a tile that is not to be displayed
# and on the border. Though it might not be an error to include
# the null tiles as part of the choice in the bulk grid, the
# intent is to restrict them, which is why the 'cull' option needs
# to be set.
#
# Common Options:
#
#  -N         name file (CSV)
#  -R         rule file (CSV)
#  -M         (output) tiled file (JSON)
#  -Q         tileset to use in the tiled file (png)
#  -s         stride to use in the tiled file
#  -[XYZ] <#> dimensional ordinals. Z should be 1 for the 2d tilesets
#  -G <#>     fixing schedule. 2 is minimum entropy cell, choosing maximum belief
#  -I <#>     maximum iteration count for a step in the belief propagation convergence
#  -S <#>     seed
#  -V <#>     verbosity level
